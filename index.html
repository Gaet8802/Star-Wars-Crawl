                    A little budy who was a bit lost in his life, wondering why
                     he could'nt find his way in this world.. 
                     He did different kind of things like physiotherapy and e-business. 
                     But nothing fit for him he was not in his element.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So he decided it was enough,
                     to be lazy everyday and do what he did'nt wanted to do. 
                     To wake up every morning with no willing.
                     it was like life went out of him.
                     He left the actual bachelor he began the same year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He searched for a formation
                     wich was about learning technology.
                     He looked about the school 19 and other free formation 
                     He found the Becode goldmine especially cause he just stopped
                     studying 10 days before and saw that the participation was free and
                     the inscription would finish 6 days later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He worked like a dog on codecademy to make full of badges
                    and sent his inscription at 23h PM when the deadline was midnight.
                    He've been selected to purchase the competition. He came at Becode
                    and passed all the personnal and team tests. He has been taken
                     and he's coding like a beast since when. this guy 
                     name is GaÃ«tano.
